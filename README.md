# Grocery Management App

## Overview

The Grocery Management App is a Python application developed using Tkinter and SQLite. This app provides a simple graphical interface for managing grocery inventory. It allows users to add items to the store inventory, transfer items to the checkout inventory (which updates the main inventory), and delete items from the inventory. The application features a full-screen interface with custom styling for a better user experience.
